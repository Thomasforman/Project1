<p>My name is Thomas Forman. I am a 19 year old photographer and media creator born and raised in Los Angeles, California. For the past 7 years I have been taking photos of anything that crosses my path. From a young age I’ve been using public transit to get to all the corridors of the large LA city. My work has ranged from cityscape, to landscape, to street, and now to more formal portraiture. I am currently a freshman in the Media Arts + Practice program within the University of Southern California School of Cinematics. My focus has largely shifted to working on social issues that can be solved through media and technology. In addition to my BA in Media Arts + Practice, I am working towards a degree in Neuroscience. I am seeking to find a way to create new mediums of art like augmented reality and combine it with brain activity and consciousness towards making a social change. Other than photography, I’ve been getting really into graphic design, website design, and videography recently. </p>
